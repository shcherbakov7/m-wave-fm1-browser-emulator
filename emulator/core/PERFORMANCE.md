# Emulator performance TODOs

Implementation is paused here while other work takes priority. Resume with
native block batching, then use measurements to choose further JIT work.

## Current checkpoint

Prepared basic blocks are cached for both guest cores. Hot register operations
compile to ARM64 and x86-64 machine code, but each native call still executes
only one guest instruction before returning to the scheduler. This preserves
instruction boundaries but has not produced a substantial firmware speedup.

Local macOS ARM64 measurements for 400 million outer `Cpu::step()` calls:

| Firmware | Before block caching/JIT | Current JIT |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Official firmware | 20.133 s | 20.682 s |
| Felucca | 12.524 s | 12.450 s |

These are single-run throughput samples, not input-to-screen latency
measurements. Diagnostic output matched between each pair. The existing full
boot regressions passed for local Felucca, published Felucca and official
firmware, with unchanged execution and peripheral counts.

## Next steps, in order

- [ ] Batch multiple native guest instructions through the existing bounded
  `Cpu::run` loop. Start with single-core sequences of pure register operations
  that fit before the next device clock tick.
- [ ] End batches before memory/device accesses, control flow, interrupt
  delivery, idle, predicate/repeat boundaries or changes to core scheduling.
  Validate instruction words through the bus and stop before changed or
  unreadable code; preserve the original fault timing and XIP permissions.
- [ ] Preserve instruction limits, stop-PC checks, tracing and single-step
  behavior. Keep ARM64 and AMD64 calling conventions, executable-page ownership
  and interpreter fallback intact.
- [ ] Use bounded batches in the GUI worker while retaining frequent input and
  command polling, pause/restart behavior and USB serial output.
- [ ] Compare batched execution against single stepping: registers, PSR, PC,
  clock phase, interrupts, code mutations and fault boundaries. Run the unchanged
  firmware regressions through the batched path as well.
- [ ] Measure both firmware throughput and button-to-LCD latency. Compare with
  the current engine under the same workload before claiming a speedup.
- [ ] Profile the remaining hot paths, broaden native translation where it
  helps, and then investigate batching with both guest cores active while
  preserving their scheduling and shared-device behavior.
